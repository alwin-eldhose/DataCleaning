# Basic Data Cleaning with R and Exploratory Data Analysis of Shark Attacks
In this project, I have worked on Global Shark Attack file, a compilation of all reported shark attacks on humans.

See Sharkattackfile.net for more details and the original excel data sheet.

Data cleaning and exploratory analysis was performed on the dataset with the following question in mind:

## Which country, Australia or South Africa, is more dangerous in terms of shark attacks on people?
I used the popular data manipulation and visualization packages like dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2.
